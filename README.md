# Binary classification metrics preview 

The notebook constists of an implementation of the stochastic gradient descent classifier for the problem based on a data set owned by
Volker Lohweg (University of Applied Sciences, Ostwestfalen-Lippe) and available under [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).

The task is to distinguish real and forged banknotes based on certain features of their images. Trained model was tested using metrics described in Chapter 3 of 
Aurelien Geron, 'Hands - On Machine Learing with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow', Helion SA, 2018. 

scikit-learn library's implementations of machine learning methods and metrics were used. Matplotlib library was used for plotting and visualization.
